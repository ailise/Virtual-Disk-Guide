      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para> I was inspired to write this document because I felt the quality of
        the information regarding commonly used functionality in virtual disk
        operation was lacking certain specific clear examples. The information
        that is available is not contained in a central location. Some concepts
        of the qemu system aren't covered at all. FAQs lead on to having an
        answer to a particular query, but many lead you to off site resources,
        some of which are no longer available on the Internet.
      </para>

      <para> What I hope to do is provide a document which will demonstrate the
        core concepts of virtual disk management. This document will concern
        itself primarily with the <command>qemu-img</command> tool and common
        GNU/Linux disk utility tools like <command>fdisk</command>. Most
        importantly to me, in the case of non-trivial examples, I hope to
        identify what the relevant technical concepts are how they work up to
        the final result of each example.
