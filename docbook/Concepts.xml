    <para>
      The best way to learn is by doing, so to learn the concepts of
      virtual disks we're going to create a 1GiB virtual disk from
      scratch. This information is applicable to the topic of disks in
      general, it's value is not limited to virtual disks.
    </para>

    <para>
      What makes virtual disks any different from actual hard drives?
      We'll examine this question by creating a virtual disk from
      scratch.
    </para>

    <para>
      What does your operating system think a disk drive is? I have a
      320 GB SATA drive in my computer which is represented in Linux
      as the file <systemitem class="resource">/dev/sda</systemitem>.
      Using <command>file</command>, <command>stat</command>
      and <command>fdisk</command> we'll see what Linux thinks the
      <systemitem class="resource">/dev/sda</systemitem> file is.
    </para>

    <para>
      Lets start out by looking at what a regular drive looks like to
      our operating system. Throughout this document the regular drive
      we'll be comparing our findings against will be a 320G SATA hard
      drive drive that Linux references as <systemitem
      class="resource">/dev/sda</systemitem>. The following example
      shows some basic information about the device.
    </para>

      The term "block" is generally interchangeable with the term
      "sector". The only difference in their meaning is
      contextual. It's common usage to say block when referring to the
      data being referenced and to use sector when speaking about disk
      geometry. Officially the term "data block" was defined by
      <orgname>ANSI ASC X3</orgname> in ANSI X3.221-199xata

      Storage units need to be clearly defined. Luckily some very

      defined binary prefixes for use in the fields of data processing
      and data transmission. Below are some applied to bytes. See

	A much simpler way to create partitions (still using

	  Instead of using <command>fdisk</command> on
	  <filename>disk1.raw</filename> directly, we'll create a loop
	  device and associate <filename>disk1.raw</filename> with

	  Unfortunately for <filename>disk1.raw</filename>, it will
	  never be anything more than just a file. The operating just
	  system doesn't have interfaces for block operations against
	  files. As the kernel creates the block special device
	  <systemitem class="resource">/dev/sda</systemitem> to
	  represent my hard drive, we need to create a block special
	  device to represent our virtual disk. This is called a loop
	  device<footnote><para> Don't confuse the often misused term
	  "loopback device" with a "loop device." In networking a
	  loopback device refers to a virtual interface used for
	  routing within a host. <systemitem
	  class="domainname">localhost</systemitem> is the standard
	  hostname given to the loopback address <systemitem
	  class="ipaddress">127.0.0.1</systemitem>. See <link
	  xl:href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1700">rfc1700</link>

	  e.g., <systemitem class="resource">/dev/loop1</systemitem>,
	  like a translator.

	<para>
	  With a loop device inserted between programs and our disk
	  image we can view and operate on the disk image as if it
	  were a regular drive. When accessed through a loop device
	  <command>fdisk</command> can properly determine the number
	  of cylinders, heads, and everything else required to create
	  partitions.

	  Unlike <systemitem class="resource">/dev/sda</systemitem> we
	  can't just create a partition on the first <systemitem

	  it as <systemitem

	<para>
	  An "offset" just means how far from the beginning of a

	  going to create a device mapped to the first partition
	  (Linux does this automatically for regular disks during the
	  boot process). Partitions don't start on the first block of
	  a device because filesystem information is stored there. To
	  specify the offset we just need to know what sector the
	  partition (<systemitem
	  class="resource">loop0p1</systemitem>) starts
	  on. <command>fdisk</command> can give us this
	  information. (Spoiler: 9 times out of 10 the offset for the
	  first partition will be 512 * 63 = 32256).
